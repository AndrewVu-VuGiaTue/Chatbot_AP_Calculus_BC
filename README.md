# Chatbot_AP_Calculus_BC

This is the Chatbot I created while studying for AP Calculus BC exam. It is used to classify the type of the questions in 9 Chapter of Calculus BC, helping the user to revise and learn more quickly.

-I used the model `gemeni-1.5-flash` for this Chatbot.

-The classified images are stored in the file `data`.

-Replace the sample API key in `example_API` with your own API key from `https://aistudio.google.com/u/1/prompts/new_chat`.
